Bassam Ahmed 1:24 PM: Hey Juthika!
My name's Bassam and I'm a second-year CS student at UW; I saw your profile while checking out Faire's page on LinkedIn, and would love to connect with a fellow UWaterloo student! :)

Juthika Hoque (She/Her) 1:24 PM: hey! nice to connect with you :)

Bassam Ahmed 5:29 PM: Thanks for connecting!
I guess we're both looking for Summer 2024 internships lol, how are you finding the co-op market so far?

Juthika Hoque (She/Her) 10:57 AM: itâ€™s not horrible! not as bad as the past couple terms at least

Bassam Ahmed 1:42 PM: Oh thatâ€™s good to hear!
Especially when thereâ€™s so much doom and gloom about the tech market right now
What area are you searching in, if you donâ€™t mind sharing? (Like web dev, app dev, embedded, etc.)


Juthika Hoque (She/Her) 2:59 PM: mostly web dev! what about you?

Bassam Ahmed 9:47 PM: Same! I started in web dev and that's where I'm most proficient I think but I'm trying to explore other areas, primarily data stuff with python and some low level embedded stuff, just to get a feel for different things.

How's work at Faire, if you don't mind sharing? I would love to know what kinda stack you're using and impact that you're able to have over there :))

Juthika Hoque (She/Her) 10:53 PM: work at Faire is really good! the culture is amazing and interns get treated as full timers, so you'd get pretty good projects with a big impact on the users

for the frontend the stack is React Typescript & ProtoBuffers for api calls
for the backend the stack is Kotlin (JPA) & MySQL

Bassam Ahmed 6:14 AM: That sounds awesome!
Also another question: did you apply for Faire externally or through WaterlooWorks? Asking because thereâ€™s a Data Science internship open on LinkedIn right now but thereâ€™s *so* many applicants itâ€™s actually kinda demotivating lol :,))

Juthika Hoque (She/Her) 3:54 PM: i applied through waterloo works! thereâ€™s a better chance to get through that way probably

Bassam Ahmed 8:25 PM: but yeah i get that external apps are always very demotivating ðŸ˜… apply anyways tho!! you never know

Juthika Hoque (She/Her) 7:23 PM: Ah I see, makes sense.
Thanks for the great advice, will definitely need it during the upcoming recruiting season! :))
